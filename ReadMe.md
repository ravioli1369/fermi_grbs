# Statistical Analysis of Meter Class Telescopes On Fermi GRBs

## Getting Started
This repository contains the code used to perform the statistical analysis of the meter class telescopes on Fermi GRBs. More specifically, if a meter class telescope such as the GROWTH India Telescope were to perform follow up oberservations on Fermi GBM triggers then **insert outcome here**

## Prerequisites
The code is written in Python 3.6.11 and uses the following packages:

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
