# Statistical Analysis of Meter Class Telescopes On Fermi GRBs

## Getting Started

PH303 - Supervised Learning Project, under Prof. Varun Bhalerao, Dept of Physics, IIT Bombay

This repository contains the code used to perform the statistical analysis of the meter class telescopes on Fermi GRBs. More specifically, "To what degree can a meter-class telescope, like GIT, be used to follow up Fermi GRB localizations?"

## Prerequisites
The code is written in Python 3.6.11 and uses the following packages:

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
